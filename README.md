# SIFT-Based Object Detection

This project demonstrates the use of **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)** for object detection in images and videos using OpenCV. It identifies features that are invariant to scale, rotation, and illumination, and locates a query object inside a target image or video stream.

## üìÅ Files
- `sift_object_detection.py`: Main Python script with functions to process both images and videos using SIFT.
- `SIFT.pdf`: Reference paper by David G. Lowe introducing the SIFT algorithm.
- `SIFT_Assignment.pdf`: Assignment sheet outlining the task and bonus objective.

## üìå Features
- Feature detection using **SIFT**.
- Descriptor matching with **BFMatcher** and **ratio test** for filtering good matches.
- Draws keypoints on the detected object in a **target image**.
- Tracks and draws bounding boxes in a **video stream**.
- Saves and downloads the result files (`result.png` and `output_video.mp4`).

## üß™ How It Works

### 1. Image Processing
- Detects keypoints and descriptors in both the query and target images.
- Matches descriptors using BFMatcher with KNN.
- Applies Lowe's ratio test to filter good matches.
- Draws matched keypoints on the target image.

### 2. Video Processing (Bonus)
- Reads frames from the video.
- Applies SIFT and matches query image to every frame.
- If enough good matches are found, it draws a bounding box around the detected object.
- Saves and downloads the annotated video.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. Run the notebook in **Google Colab**.
2. Upload the **query image** when prompted.
3. Choose the mode (`image` or `video`).
4. Upload the **target image** or **video** based on the chosen mode.
5. Processed results will be automatically displayed and downloaded.

## üì¶ Dependencies
Make sure these libraries are installed (already available in Colab):
```python
cv2
numpy
matplotlib
google.colab
```
